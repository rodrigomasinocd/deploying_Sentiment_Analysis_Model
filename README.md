# SageMaker Deployment Project

In this project, I code a complete project using SageMaker. The objective is to use a web page to receive a review of a movie and return the emotion behind the text. The web page will send the review to the model and will receive the result.

### The application architecture diagram is:

The original code without solutions can be found in the original Udacity SageMaker Deployment repository.

This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost mini-project (which can be found in the original repository) should provide enough background.



## Setup instructions
Clone the GitHub repository

```
cd SageMaker
git clone https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment.git
exit
```
